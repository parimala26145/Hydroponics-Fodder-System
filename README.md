# Smart Low-Cost Solar Operated Hydroponics Fodder System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Low-Cost Solar Operated Hydroponics Fodder System** is an innovative and sustainable agricultural solution designed to produce fresh, healthy, and nutrient-rich green fodder for livestock using minimal water, space, and energy.

Traditional fodder cultivation requires large land areas, high water usage, and long growth cycles. This project overcomes these challenges by implementing a **soil-less hydroponic technique** powered entirely by **renewable solar energy**, making it highly suitable for rural and resource-limited environments.

This system provides an eco-friendly alternative for farmers, dairy industries, and agricultural innovators by enabling fodder production throughout the year with reduced operational costs.
